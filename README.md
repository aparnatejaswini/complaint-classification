The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is a U.S. government agency responsible for consumer protection in the financial sector. It was established under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 in response to the financial crisis of 2007-2008.

The CFPB's primary mission is to ensure that financial products and services are fair, transparent, and competitive. It works to protect consumers from unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices by financial institutions. The bureau has the authority to regulate various financial products and services, including mortgages, credit cards, student loans, and other consumer financial products.

One of the key functions of CFPB is Complaint Handling. The bureau operates a consumer complaint database where individuals can submit complaints about financial products and services that are sent to the organisation for a response. Complaint data can be downloaded from the website or through their API. The file complaints.csv
